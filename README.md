# Decentralized Timeshare Management System

A blockchain-based platform built on Ethereum that revolutionizes timeshare ownership, trading, and usage through smart contracts. The system comprises four core components that work together to create a transparent and flexible ecosystem.

## Core Components

### üè† TimeshareToken (ERC1155)
- **Ownership Representation**: Tokenizes property ownership (1 token ID = 1 property)
- **Dynamic Units**: Track fractional ownership percentages through token amounts
- **Property Management**: 
  - Create/update properties with metadata (location, amenities, fees)
  - Mint initial ownership distributions
  - Enforce annual maintenance fee payments

### üí∞ TimeshareMarketplace
- **Peer-to-Peer Trading**: 
  - List ownership units with custom pricing
  - Purchase units with ETH
  - Platform fee mechanism (configurable %)
- **Secure Escrow**: 
  - Automatic token transfers on successful sales
  - Reentrancy-protected transactions

### üó≥Ô∏è TimeshareGovernance
- **Proposal System**:
  - Property managers/owners can propose improvements
  - Voting weighted by ownership stake
  - Quorum (25% participation) and majority rules
- **Transparent Execution**:
  - Time-limited voting periods
  - On-chain proposal tracking

### üóìÔ∏è ReservationSystem
- **Week Management**:
  - Reserve specific weeks (1-52) based on ownership
  - Maintenance blocking/unblocking
  - Rental marketplace integration
- **Fee Enforcement**:
  - Mandatory maintenance fee checks
  - ETH payment processing for fees/rentals
